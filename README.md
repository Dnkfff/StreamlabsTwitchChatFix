# StreamlabsTwitchChatFix
If you want to participate, contribute and build normal workable twitch chad(in case if it hasn't been workin on your obs, you can leave your PR's here.)
My tryes to fix reflection of chat onto OBS view page.
 - Have tryed to run it on html+css+js, didn't worked well. So I've decided to rewrite it to React.

## ðŸ‘‡ Basically, it is looking like this 0_Ð¾

![HTML.html](/img/streamLabsCode(html).jpg?raw=true "Optional Title")
![JSx.js](/img/streamLabsCode(js).jpg?raw=true "Optional Title")

and CSS was not been touched, everything else was rewrited

# Now it is working, hopefully. 

### TODO
- add task list
- fix styles
- get these shit up, so it could work well
