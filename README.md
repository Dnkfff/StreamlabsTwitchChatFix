# StreamlabsTwitchChatFix-
Have tryed to run it on html+css+js, didn't worked well. So I've decided to rewrite it to React.

## ðŸ‘‡ Basically, it is looking like this à² _à² 

![HTML.html](/img/streamLabsCode(html).jpg?raw=true "Optional Title")
![JSx.js](/img/streamLabsCode(js).jpg?raw=true "Optional Title")

and CSS was not been touched, everything else was rewrited
